# Flutter Template for Drupal CMS

 Flutter Getx project is a robust and clean Template to build an App that integrates all functionality of Drupal Using REST API(JSONAPI core module), In this project I used the powerful features of Getx like state management, Dependency injection, route management, and in other side the Drupal core JSON:API module implements the JSON:API spec for Drupal entities. It provides a zero-configuration required, opinionated, way to allow RESTful CRUD for a Drupal site's content.
