1.Deprecated----> Translations: you could't delete any translated node(have language other than defaultlanguage) because it not supported by JSONAPI
if you want to delete it you can use the web app.
 
2.We use countryCode as prefix for URL to load settings label and descriptions, in addition for CRUD Operation on entities
Without this prefix you cannot delete, Edit, Add any translated entities.
more information: https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-modules/jsonapi-module/translations

We use LangCode as queryString parameter to load the list of translated entities depend on this parameter value

3.The scope is used to limit Application's access by user account so
   it give a user's token access additional role although may he dont have it, so the user have 2 roles with this token
   and one with web access
